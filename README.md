# Designing a LQR and a LQG controller for Crane with double pendulum

# Project Outcomes
1. Derived the equations of motion using the Euler Lagrange equation and represent the system as a non-linear state space equation.
2. Linearized the state space equation.
3. Obtain conditions for which the linearized system is controllable
4. Designed a LQR controller.
5. Checked if the system is observable
6. Derived a leunberger observer for each of the output vectors.
7. Designed a LQG controller with Kalman Filter.
